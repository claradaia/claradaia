Hi, I’m Clara!

I graduated in Computer Science in 2018 and was a web developer for a few years. In 2020 I took a huge turn in my life and now I'm an Economist!

I love the open source community and learning about computer architecture. I hope to contribute to the Linux Kernel someday :)

In 2021 I also developed a small game with my husband and a friend, using Game Maker Studio 2.
